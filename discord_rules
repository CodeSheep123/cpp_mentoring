__**§1: Behavior rules**__
```
0) We aim for a friendly atmosphere and expect members to respect this. avoid elitist/sexist/porn/troll/racist/inappropriate talk. Be patient with those willing to learn and be kind to those willing to teach.

1) Respect others' likings and opinions. If you can't stay friendly and polite, don't participate in a discussion.

2) Off-topic discussions are at moderator discretion. Feel free to talk about anything and everything, but stop if a moderator tells you to do so. 

3) Abuse of any server service isn't tolerated.

4) Do not ping people randomly.

5) No systematic advertising of other Discord servers (mentioning that servers exist for informative purposes is fine).

6) Respect the Discord ToS.
```

**__§2: Asking questions__**

See <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask> on how to ask a good question that will save both you and the people you are asking time.

When you ask questions about specific problems in your code, please provide the source code or a minimal complete example that reproduces the problem.

Use a paste service if you are posting a lot of code. Prefer one that can compile code:
<https://godbolt.org/>
<https://wandbox.org/>
<https://hastebin.com/>


**__§3: Rule breakage__**

In case you are having trouble with anyone in the channel, or you are observing inappropriate talk, please contact one of the moderators (you can identify them by their Discord role).


__**§4: Loaded discussion topics**__

Be wary that some topics of discussion might be more inflammatory than others. Examples include politics, gender issues and Vim VS EMACS. Discussions around these topics are not banned but since they often become inflamed and can last a long time, moderators might ask you to move it to an appropriate channel. Also be aware and respectful of the fact that some people may be extra sensitive to different topics.

__**§5: Memes/images**__

Pornographic and illegal content is strictly forbidden. Other types of NSFW content are only allowed in the Off-Topic section of channels, and has to be explicitly tagged as such, and given spoiler tags (`||content here||`). Moderators reserves the right to give the final judgement on what is appropriate or not.
